# Homework 1: Code with AI

The due date is Feb 13 at midnight. If you are using the late days, please note in the head of README.md that “I used XX late days this time, and I have XX days remaining”.

The main purpose of this homework is to help you:

- Get experience with AI coding
- Learn how to decompose a problem into smaller tasks and find the right tools to solve them with the help of AI
- Improve your prompt engineering skills
- Conduct the coding task you have never learned before with the help of AI

Your homework repository should have all the source code for the problems below, though the real website could be based on the repository hosted under your own GitHub account.

In the `README.md` of your homework repository, you can write the report section as a case-study tutorial on how to use AI copilot for the following three problems. You can list the AI tools  you used, and how you designed and adjusted your prompts. You can add screenshots or even share the video of how you used these AI tools and the intermediate products generated by AI if you believe it will help the readers learn.

## Problem 1. Github Website for Your Coding Blog

Create a homepage for a website for your **coding blog**. The website should be hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can design the homepage by yourself in any proper style you like. You may need to make the design expandable to add more content from our future assignments. The link to the homepage should be added to the `README.md` of your homework repository so that anyone can access the homepage and the following two webpages from the Internet using this link.

## Problem 2. Game Coding: Pac-Man

Add a new page to your website for [Pac-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man). The users can directly play the Pac-Man game on your webpage. As long as people can recognize it as some variation of the Pac-Man game by common sense, you can decide how complicated the game should be by yourself. The link to the game webpage should be added to the homepage in Problem 1.

[Play Pac-Man Game](pacman.html)

## Problem 3. Data Scaffolding from the Internet

Add a new page to your website for auto-updating the latest papers from arXiv with the keywords you are interested in. This webpage should have the following features:

- The webpage should list the latest papers from arXiv with the keywords you pick. You can decide on the paper list style by yourself.
- The list should include paper titles, authors, abstracts, and direct links to PDFs.
- The paper list should be auto-updated every midnight by updating the latest papers from arXiv.
- The link to the webpage should be added in the homepage in Problem 1.
- Design the webpage by yourself in any proper style you think the readers would like.

**Tip 1**: You can ask AI how to deploy the website by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

**Tip 2**: You can ask AI to teach you how to use [arXiv API](https://arxiv.org/help/api/user-manual) to fetch the latest papers from arXiv.

**Tip 3**: You can ask AI to teach you how to use [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to automate the process of updating the webpage.

**Tip 4**: You can use [Copy Coder](https://copycoder.ai/) to help you design the webpage UI from the style you like.

## Introduction:

This Homework 1 repository contains the code and output created through exploring different ways to use AI to generate code and complete the tasks specified in the homework. In this homework, I accomplished and have recorded the following:

1) I created a website named "Parker's Portal" as a GitPage 
2) I created a Pac-Man game as a webpage inside "Parker's Portal"
3) I created a webpage containing a list the latest papers from arXiv with the keywords "opioid", "cancer", and "analgesic" that is auto-updated every day at midnight. 

## Installation

1. Clone and navigate to the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/homework-1-ptope.git
cd your_directory_name
```
2. Install required dependencies

## Usage

## Report

### Website Creation

To create the website "Parker's Portal", I asked Claude via AI copilot to generate a coding blog, with a sidebar for additional webpages that could be embedded within the website. 

Once the base code was generated, I asked copilot to revise the code to to implement style and formatting changes to my liking. This was the smoothest part of my interchanges with AI copilot when completing the set of tasks for this homework.

### Pac-Man Creation

Creating Pac-Man is where my relationship with AI copilot began to deteriorate.

To begin, I prompted copilot with the following:

"Create a single html file for a Pac-Man game"

This was unsuccessful, as copilot only generated a black canvas element with a yellow circle that did not move, which I believe was supposed to represent "Pac-Man". 

I then prompted copilot more specifically, describing what I wanted the grid layout to be for Pac-Man's maze, how I wanted the ghosts to move, how the logic rules for the game should be defined, etc. 

This iterative process was unssuccessful, so I turned to PromptPerfect in a desperate attempt to help me generate a successful PacMan game. This gave me hope, and was helpful in guiding my prompt engineeering. For example, this is one of the prompts PromptPerfect helped me generate to provide copilot:

#### Example Prompt from PromptPerfect

You are provided with a task to generate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code necessary to create a basic Pac-Man game.

Requirements:
1. A canvas element where the game will be played, including a maze with a black background and blue walls.
2. Red dots placed in the maze, equally spaced, for Pac-Man to eat.
3. JavaScript code to define the game's logic, including:
   - Pac-Man's movement controlled by the arrow keys, and Pac-Man's mouth points in the direction applied by the arrow keys. 
   - Ghosts' random movement in each direction within the maze.
   - Multiple ghosts that look like a cartoon ghost that move slowly in relation to Pac-Man. 
   - Collision detection and game over condition when Pac-Man bumps into a ghost.
   - Scoring system to display the current score based on the number of red dots Pac-Man eats, with the total number of red dots also displayed.
   - "Game over" pop up on screen displaying the score that is initiated when Pac-Man either eats all of the dots without running into a ghost, or when Pac-Man runs into a ghost. 
4. CSS styling for the game, including the design of Pac-Man, ghosts, the maze, and the red dots.

Please follow these steps:

Step 1: Create the HTML structure.
1. Define a canvas element for the game.
2. Include references to the CSS and JavaScript files.

Step 2: Write the CSS to style the game.
1. Style the canvas and game elements (Pac-Man, ghosts, and the maze).
2. Ensure the background color of the canvas is black and the walls of the maze are blue.
3. Style the red dots in the maze.

Step 3: JavaScript code to implement game logic.
1. Initialize the canvas and game elements.
2. Create a maze layout on the canvas with walls defined in blue and red dots placed within the maze paths, evenly spaced.
3. Implement Pac-Man's movement controlled by the arrow keys.
4. Implement ghosts' random movement within the maze.
5. Implement collision detection between Pac-Man, ghosts, walls, and red dots.
6. Develop a scoring system where each red dot eaten by Pac-Man counts as one point. Display the current score along with the total number of red dots.
7. End the game when Pac-Man collides with a ghost.

Below is an example structure:

HTML:
```html



    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

Generate the complete code for the Pac-Man game using the provided structure and guidelines, ensuring Pac-Man's movement, ghosts' random movement, collisions, and the scoring system work as specified.

This example prompt was at first helpful in getting copilot closer to what a Pac-Man game should ideally be. However, in the end, it appeared as if copilot got stuck in a revising and debugging loop and couldn't aid me further (I realize relationships are a two way street and this was also likely a failure on my part). 

I then turned to Junwei, who directed me towards the Claude website. This got me going in the right direction. With Claude (as in the website version) NOT the copilot version, I was able to revert to my origianl prompt ("Generate a single .html file for a Pac-Man game") and receive the exact game that is included in "Parker's Portal" in one try.

#### Pac-Man Testing

To see how well the game performed, I sent the .html file to my partner. He played it, but was mad because he couldn't win, as there were 4 dots that Pac-Man could not eat that were isolated in the bottom. The paths form a disconnected graph, which would correspond to a low resilience. Hence, the proposed game constructed by AI is sub-optimal with respect to the network structure (even AI isn't perfect). 

### Paper Archive Creation

Given that Claude was the most helpful AI tool for my next step in creating an automatically updated list of papers I am interested in (relating to opioids and cancer) on my webpage. 

I provided Claude with a prompt defining what list of papers I wanted to retrieve from arXiv, and that I wanted there to be an automatic update to this list every night. I then asked Claude to create a Java file that would pull the papers of interest, and write an .html file corresponding to the webpage I intended to embed that would have matching styling to other webpages in "Parker's Portal". 

Claude helped me generate `update-papers-js.js`, which pulls the applicable papers, and generates a .json datafile containing the paper data. `arxiv-webpage.html` is automatically updated when `papers_data.json` is updated. 

While I was working, I was able to manually update the papers on my server using the following code:

```bash
## To push archive changes manually: 

# Navigate to your working directory
cd /Users/parkertope/Desktop/G1\ WINTER/BST\ 236/homework-1-ptope/my-coding-blog

# Install required packages if you haven't already
npm install axios xml2js

# Run the update script
node update-papers-js.js
```
